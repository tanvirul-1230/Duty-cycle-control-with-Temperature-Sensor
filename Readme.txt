1. Temperature-Controlled PWM Motor Speed

🎯 Overview

This project, built with an Arduino Uno, monitors ambient temperature using an LM35 sensor. It automatically adjusts the speed of a DC motor by generating a PWM signal, with the motor's speed being directly proportional to the temperature. The current temperature (in Celsius) and motor speed (as a percentage) are displayed in real-time on a 16x2 I2C LCD.

✨ Key Features

Reads real-time temperature from an LM35 analog sensor.

Displays the current temperature (°C) and motor speed (%) on a 16x2 I2C LCD.

Generates a PWM signal to control the speed of a DC motor using an L298N driver.

Motor speed is linearly mapped to a specific temperature range (off below 20°C, full speed above 50°C).

We have used an LED to show the duty cycle instead of a DC Motor. But the dc motor will produce the same result as it is for output purpose only.
Used DHT11 as LM35 was not available on local market

🔧 How It Works

The logic is straightforward:

Read Sensor: The LM35 sensor outputs an analog voltage (10mV per degree Celsius). This voltage is read by one of the Arduino's analog-to-digital converter (ADC) pins.

Calculate Temp: The code converts the raw ADC value (0-1023) into a floating-point temperature value in degrees Celsius.

Map Speed: This temperature value is then mapped to a PWM duty cycle value (0-255). Based on the code, this mapping is:

MIN_TEMP (20°C) = 0 speed (0% duty cycle)

MAX_TEMP (50°C) = 255 speed (100% duty cycle)

Control Motor: The analogWrite() function sends this PWM signal to the ENA (Enable) pin of the L298N motor driver, which in turn delivers the correct amount of power to the motor.

Display: Simultaneously, the calculated temperature and speed percentage are sent to the I2C LCD for real-time monitoring.
